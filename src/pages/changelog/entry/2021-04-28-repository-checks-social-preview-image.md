Today we are introducing a new Repository Check: The **Social Preview Image**.

When your repository is getting shared on Social Media, a nice-looking image can boost engagement with the post and the project.
That is the reason why GitHub [introduced auto-generated Open Graph Images lately](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-04-21-opengraph-images-for-github-repositories-commits-issues-and-pull-requests/).

However, a custom image that fits your project is still a unique and helpful indicator.

Since today, this property is checked for you in our [Repository Checks](/changelog/entry/2021-04-26-repository-checks-open-source-best-practices).
You can find the check in your Check-Dashboard.
