Today we are introducing a new Repository Check: The **README**.

For many of us engineers, placing a *README.md* file into the repository root seems to be obvious.
However, when we are in a rush, we all know what will happen: We overlook the most obvious things.
Like placing a *README.md* file into the repository root.

We can't prevent forgetting it, but we can remind you about fixing this.

Since today, this property is checked for you in our [Repository Checks](/changelog/entry/2021-04-26-repository-checks-open-source-best-practices).
You can find the check in your Check-Dashboard.
