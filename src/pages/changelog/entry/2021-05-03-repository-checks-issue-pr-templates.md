You find a new project, download and play around with it.
After some time, you find an unexpected behavior or even found a UI glitch that you aim to fix and push upstream.
You are putting the effort in, creating the issue or pull request, and waiting for the first response.

The first response comes quickly, but it isn't a "Merged, thank you!" or an "Oh, I will fix it immediately".
It is a list of questions to get a better understanding of the change or issue.
You don't have time to answer these now because you are in a rush.
And later: You forget it.

The issue is going stale, and the Pull Request gets never merged.

To improve the process and not end up like in the story, using [issue templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository) and [pull request templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository) can provide a solution.

They guide the contributor on which information is essential to get the issue or the pull request going.

Since today, both template types are checked for you in our [Repository Checks](/changelog/entry/2021-04-26-repository-checks-open-source-best-practices).
You can find the check in your Check-Dashboard.
