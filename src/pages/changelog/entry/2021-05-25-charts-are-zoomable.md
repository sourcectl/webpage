Some charts can be hard to read, especially when there are a lot of data points available.
That's why **we are introducing zoomable charts today**!

Charts that support zooming provide a short description below.

You can:
* Select an area to zoom in by clicking the mouse, hold and drag it
* Move left and right by pressing the `shift`-key and the mouse and move it to left or right
* Reset the zoom to the original zoom level by clicking the `Reset Zoom` button below the chart

Have fun while playing around!
