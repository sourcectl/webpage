Since the launch of sourcectl, many graphs have covered only your top repositories.

Getting a traffic graph of a single and non-top repository was not possible.
Until now!

We are introducing single repository views with:

- Stars over time
- The last six people who have starred the repository
- Clone and View traffic for the complete timeframe
- All repository checks, including results

Have fun while checking the growth of your projects!
